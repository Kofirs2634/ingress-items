# Notes for COMM icons
To fit some icons on top of hexagons, centering both svg's, you'll need to vertically displace them some pixels:
- comm_icon_field_created.svg to be displaced 66px up
- comm_icon_field_destroyedd.svg to be displaced 66px up
- comm_icon_portal_captured.svg to be displaced 99px up
- comm_icon_drone.svg to be displaced 76px up
